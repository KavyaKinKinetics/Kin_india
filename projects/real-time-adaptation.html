                    KinKinetics had an incredible experience at the <strong>21st Reinventing Space Conference</strong>, hosted by the British Interplanetary Society at the Royal Aeronautical Society in Mayfair. The three-day event was packed with engaging sessions, including the prestigious Gala Dinner and Arthur Awards. The highlight of the conference for us was participating in hands-on activities like the Soyuz controller demo, which allowed attendees to practice dockingâ€”a unique and fun experience!

                    One of the most inspiring aspects of the event was being part of the <strong>"Voice of the Next Generation"</strong> workshop. This session brought together talented young professionals and students to discuss the future of the UK space sector and sustainable space management. Representing KinKinetics, we had the chance to collaborate with like-minded peers and contribute fresh ideas to shape the next chapter of space exploration.
